## 👀 About Me

- **Pronouns:** He / Him  
- **Current Program:** BSc in **Information Systems** at **University of São Paulo (USP)**  
- **Core Interests:** Applied Mathematics • AI & Algorithms • Education • Quantum Computing • Social Impact  
- **Fun Fact:** I learn best by building from the ground up—from Minecraft Redstone CPUs to neural networks and custom compilers.

### 💡 The Spark

My tech journey began by shadowing my dad at **IBM**, where I joined hands-on workshops like building robots with Arduino and designing simple games. Later, a tough loss at the Brazilian Math Olympiad challenged me—I came back the next year with a perfect score in Phase 1. That moment ignited a lifelong love for **math**, **science**, and building things that matter.

Big inspirations for me? Names like **Newton**, **Einstein**, and **Hawking**—I’ve always dreamed of leaving a mark on the world through science and technology.

## 🌱 Currently Exploring

- Building a **compiler** from scratch to deeply understand language design and low-level architecture  
- Developing **NeuroLite**, a neural network framework made with just NumPy and pandas  
- Studying **AI algorithms**, from fundamentals to cutting-edge models like Transformers  
- Diving into **Computer Vision** and **NLP** with real-world applications in mind  
- Exploring **quantitative models** for social problems  
- Contributing to educational and accessibility-focused tech initiatives

## 🧠 Learning by Building

I believe theory is best tested through creation. For example, while learning **linear algebra**, I realized that matrix transformations could let me render 3D objects in 2D space. That led me to build a full 3D renderer in Python using `tkinter` and `NumPy`. Rebuilding it in **C/C++ with OpenGL** later helped me understand compilers and memory management—and that curiosity turned into a new project: writing a compiler from scratch.

## 🚀 Selected Projects

### 🔬 **NeuroLite** *(In Development)*  
An educational ML framework built from scratch using just NumPy and pandas.  
> Learning goals: forward/backpropagation, optimizers, activation functions, and data preprocessing. Future plans: add support for transformers and vision tasks.

### 🛠 **Custom Compiler** *(In Progress)*  
From tokenizer to parser to codegen, a ground-up compiler project inspired by low-level exploration while linking OpenGL.

### 🧠 **3D Renderer in C/C++** *(In Progress)*  
Real-time engine using OpenGL, focused on threading and memory. A continuation of my original Python renderer.

### 💾 **8‑Bit CPU in Minecraft Redstone** *(Restarting)*  
Fully simulated CPU with ALU, memory, and control units—an early hands-on dive into computer architecture.
